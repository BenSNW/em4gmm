{"name":"em4gmm","tagline":"Fast clustering Expectation Maximization algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models.","body":"Introduction\r\n------------\r\nIn statistics, the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method for finding maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of parameters in statistical models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables.\r\n\r\nFor this reason EM is frequently used for data clustering, verification and identification of the speaker (biometric tasks), author profiling based on his documents, automatic document categorization, and many more applications.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n* [Download the latest release of the source code on a zip file](https://github.com/juandavm/em4gmm/zipball/master).\r\n* Clone the repository: `git clone git://github.com/juandavm/em4gmm.git`\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIn order to compile this program, you need first compile and install the [zlib library](http://www.zlib.net) from their website, or using your preferred software distribution channels (aptitude, yum, macports, etc) in order to install it (with the dev packages). On some systems this library can be installed by default.\r\n\r\nOn Mac Os X and Linux distributions you can simple use the make command on the system shell to compile it, and then sudo make install to install it on yout system (by default on /usr/bin). We recommend the use of the lastest version of the GCC compiler (because the code generated by LLVM is, for now, much slower).\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n* [Download the last version of the user manual in pdf format](https://github.com/juandavm/em4gmm/blob/master/doc/UserManual.pdf?raw=true).\r\n\r\nIssues and Bugs\r\n---------------\r\nDo you have a bug or a feature request?
